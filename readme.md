Geo Ip Test
=============================

#Configuration
By default, the config file (\config\Api.php) has the option
 "ApiStatus" set to “1”,  this works as an on/off 
 button for the endpoint to work. 
 During the first database update it should
  be set to “0” for the api to show 
  updating database code message.

###Installation

- Appache

- PHP 7 or higher
- Mysql 5.5 or higher

###Why i choosed the Crontab approach?
It allows to update with determined periodicity the table without having down time.

###Why Laravel ?
There is no reason except for curiosity and learning purposes.
